# scorebot
A local scorination bot for local people. There's nothing for you here.

----

A simple discord bot to "scorinate" association football matches between fictional teams. Takes a simple discord one-line input; handy for one-off games. Implements code from [xkoranate](http://www.thirdgeek.com/ns/xkoranate/) to generate results.

Released under the same license (GNU General Public License v3.0) as per terms of the xkoranate source code.

I'll actually make a proper readme at some point. Probably when I finish writing this, tbh.
